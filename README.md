# box-program
A short C# console application which was made in Visual Studio 2013. 
The program creates 3D boxes with dimensions specified from the user and then calculates the area and volume. 
This program used object orientation to a better effect. Overloading methods were used a lot for experimentation.
I can see progression in the quality of code from my Space Invaders application. 
Class and comment use of a highermuch higher level.
